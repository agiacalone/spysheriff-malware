## Big Big Warning

This repository's executable code has *not* been de-compiled. I have included all of the original executables here for historical preservation and educational purposes. Be very warned when downloading this that it *may* infect your computer without proper precautions.

Excerpt from Wikipedia:
> SpySheriff is malware that disguises itself as anti-spyware software. It attempts to mislead the user with false security alerts, threatening them into buying the program. Like other rogue antiviruses, after producing a list of false threats, it prompts the user to pay to remove them. The software is particularly difficult to remove, since it nests its components in System Restore folders, and also blocks some system management tools. However, SpySheriff can be removed by an experienced user, antivirus software, or by using a rescue disk.
